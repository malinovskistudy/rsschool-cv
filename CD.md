};

var buildComputer = function (memory, display, processor) {
  var customComputer = {
    basicPrice: 5000,
    processor: processor,
    display: display,
    memory: memory,
    
    

    getDescription: function () {
      return 'компьютер с процессором ' + this.processor + ', диагональю ' + this.display + ', оперативной памятью ' + this.memory;
    },

    getPrice: function () {
      return this.basicPrice + processorPrice[this.processor] + displayPrice[this.display] + memoryPrice[this.memory];
    }
  };

  return customComputer;
};

var myComputer = buildComputer(8, 13, 'i7');
console.log('В корзине ' + myComputer.getDescription() + ' стоимостью ' + myComputer.getPrice());
